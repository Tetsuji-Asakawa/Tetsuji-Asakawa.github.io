<h2>History</h2>
As an example of the international communication exchange project in conformity with the concept of the Teenage Walkers Project held in Mie prefecture, Japan. The prefectural government adopted it as its regional informataization policy and implemented it from September 1997 until March 1999. Four Japanese Middle and High schools has participated in the project together with three American Middle and High schools in North Carolina and one Middle school in Singapore. The total number of the participating students in the project is around two hundreds.

<article>
The project held in Mie prefecture was realized as one of the experimental state undertakings named Digital Communities and cosponsored with the private sector. The information on the project in Mie was opened to the public for future activities of international communication exchange in a home page form. The web site created by the Division of information policy of the Mie prefectural government archived detailed records for the two years international communication exchange activities. The web address is below for your reference.

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Teenage Walkers Project Survey</h3>

<p>After one year half international exchange we asked all participating schools in Mie and North Carolina 16 queries to evaluate the activities in the Teenage Walkers Project.</p>

<p>The results are below for your reference.</p>

<h4>Q.1: Did you feel your partners existence across the national border?</h4>

<p>The sum of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the answers of Toshi Middle School was 26, &ldquo;A little&rdquo; was 4 and no one chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This query was set up to survey achievement of Self-Introduction Program in the first basic programs. Through this program we aimed that participating students could feel existence of their partners oversea. From the number of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;A little&rdquo; we estimate that almost all the students in Toshi Middle School had recognized their partners. The result of Guilford County Schools was that almost all the students had perceived existence of their partners as same as Toshi Middle School. None of them selected &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p>

<p>An interesting point is that the ratio of &ldquo;A little&rdquo; was a few more than the one in next question. Question No. 2 asked the students whether they could make a friendship with oversea or not in real life. But Question No. 1 inquired human relationship on the Internet. Though we can not say much about it because of a little difference, the students might feel familiar with each other in real life more than on the Internet. This questionnaire was done after one year half international exchange. We can not judge how much they would recognize their partners if we carry out this query in the middle of activities. At least the result of this question indicated a possibility that they could perceive their partners well on the Internet.</p>

<p>Obvious difference appeared in the result of other participating schools as compared with the one of Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools. A large fall of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, the ratio of &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; increased. We estimate that how long international exchange continued and how much activities was done might affect the background of this difference. And only Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools could implement homestays twice in a year and half. We guess that it was difficult for other schools&#8217; students to make a friend personally even they might have an interest in international exchange itself.</p>

<h4>Q.2: Did you make a friend of the person whose name and face you came to know through the international communication exchange?</h4>

<p>This question asked to determine achievement of the most important aim of Teenage Walkers Project. 28 students in Toshi Middle School said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and 2 of them &ldquo;Probably&rdquo;. All of 17 students in Guilford County Schools answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. No students in both countries chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This result revealed that all of the participating students realized the aim to make a friend oversea. We estimated that around 10 to 20 percentage of the students would be able to achieve the aim before stating the project. It was an outstanding consequence to evaluate the Teenage Walkers Project.</p>

<p>Within a year and half exchange period seven times live video conferences and twice home stay programs carried out affected this result. We think that real-time live video conference of good repute enabled the students exchange their voices and movies directly and living together in almost two weeks in the home stay programs produced face to face level communication which the Internet could never compensate for took a role to build the intimate friendship.</p>

<p>As compared with the result of Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools, other participating schools made a contrary result. Almost all students answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this question. Few of them chose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Probably&rdquo;. Though Question No. 1 asked the relationship on the Internet, this question inquired the personal friendship. Other participating schools were at a disadvantage to answer to this question because none of them held a home stay program. But a couple of students still said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;probably&rdquo; was unexpected considering no experience of direct communication. We guess that they found a friend through exchange activity on Bulletin Board in which they could write down their personal messages freely. This unforeseen result indicates a possibility that participants can make a friend oversea in cyberspace. But as a result of Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools it is obvious that face to face communication worked well to make a friendship with each other.</p>

<h4>Q.3: Did you enjoy the international activities as experienced through the Internet?</h4>

<p>This question inquired &ldquo;Did you enjoy the international activities as experienced through the Internet?&rdquo; to determine directly the result of international activities with the technology called Computer Meditated Communications Technology like the Internet. In Toshi Middle School 24 students, 80 percent of them answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 5 of them &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and 1 of them &ldquo;No&rdquo;. In Guilford County Schools 14 students said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 3 of them &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and None of them &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Though one student in Toshi Middle School chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;, almost all students in both countries seemed satisfied with the international activities on the Internet. Communication exchange program on Bulletin Board between them had been used actively after especially twice home stay programs. We can say that usage of Computer Meditated Communications Technology as a substitute for direct communication exchange was effective.</p>

<p>As to the result of other participating schools, in the Japanese schools the ratio of the students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; was not much, &ldquo;A little&rdquo; increased and &ldquo;No&rdquo; was a few. In the American schools, almost all the students chose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;A little&rdquo; was few and non of them &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We think the reason why the ratio of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; answered by the American students and &ldquo;No&rdquo; never chose is that many of them generally had no problem to use computer according to the result of Question No. 4 which asked computer usage and recent advanced computer education in America. For the present, we guess both of countries schools seemed satisfied the international activities on the Internet.</p>

<p>According to the answers to Question No. 14 asked most favorite activity in the Teenage Walkers Project, many students selected a live video conference program as their most favorite activity. We think that the program influenced the result of this question.</p>

<h4>Q.4: Were you able to make good use of the computer for international activities?</h4>

<p>Free description<br/>
1. It is difficult to think about the contents for home pages and scan a picture for them.<br/>
2. Translation into English was a hard job.<br/>
3. I had never used computer before so that even a single sentence I struggled to write.<br/>
4. I could learn how to use computer soon, but not teach other students.<br/>
5. Color combination for a home page was difficult.</p>

<p>Before starting the project almost all students in Toshi Middle School had had no experience to use latest model computers so that they needed to learn how to use them in advance. As a result of the practice 8 students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 19 ones &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and 3 of them &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Within about a half year applied on the practice they mastered word processing software for making a home page and technique of scanning a picture as a minimum requirement for the international activities on the Internet. It should be great advancement considering their initial condition.</p>

<p>As compared with the ration of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in Guilford County Schools there is still a gap of computer skill between both counties students. Considering advantage of computer education and the long experience which the American schools possessed the gap is not so much a problem. North Carolina is one the most well known states which has been putting great emphasis on computer and Internet education and Guilford County Schools is leading the top of them. From start there was an undeniable gap behind. But advancement to use computer is depended on how much each student have an interest in it. We can not easily determine the result from the difference of educational condition.</p>

<p>The result in other participating schools was similar to the one between Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools. Many American students chose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, a small number of them &ldquo;A little&rdquo;. None of them answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; as same as Guilford County Schools. We can understand the result considering all of the schools belong to North Carolina. According to the period of international activities the ration of &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the Japanese students varied. We think that the Japanese students got used to computer naturally through communication activities on the Internet.</p>

<h4>Q.5: Did you obtain the latest news about foreign culture directly from your partners?</h4>

<p>This question is related to Current Trend Introduction Program in the basic four introductory programs. This program was set for exchanging current trend information of countries and areas in which participating students live. The result of this question indicated how much information exchanged among them. The number of the students in Toshi Middle Schools who answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; was 9, &ldquo;A little&rdquo; was 11, and &ldquo;No&rdquo; was 10. On the other hand 6 students in Guilford County Schools answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and 6 did &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and 5 did &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As compared with the result of previous questions, the ratio of answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; increased in both countries schools. We think the reason why language problem was there between them. After the Current Trend Introduction Program held in the early stage of communication activities they had chances to exchange latest information through Bulletin Board or live video conferences. But all of the activities needed enough English ability to accomplish them. We guess that some of the students in Toshi Middle School felt difficulty to use English at all times. And the Bulletin Board was opened freely for the students. We observed one tendency that some students used it quite often and some others not so much. We guess the tendency caused one reason that the result varied widely.</p>

<p>Similar tendency were observed in other participating schools. The ratio of answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; increased. The reasons might be the language problem and frequent usage of Bulletin Board the same as between Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools.</p>

<p>Generally the ratio of &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the American schools was not much because of the advantage of English for the international activities.</p>

<h4>Q.6: Did you take an interest in your partner&rsquo;s culture?</h4>

<p>This question tried to survey how much interest in and understanding partner&rsquo;s culture the students of both countries had. This question is a little ambiguous as compared with Question No. 7 and 8. 20 students in Toshi Middle School answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 9 ones &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and 1 of them &ldquo;No&rdquo;. All of the students in Guilford County Schools answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Though it was sorry that one Japanese student chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;, this result indicated that many students of both countries had an interest in partner&rsquo;s culture.</p>

<p>In the background of all American students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, they took a Japanese class is a primary factor which effected the result. We easily guess that all of them had already had an interest in Japanese culture more or less before taking the class. And they had actually studied Japanese and the culture for a couple of years. Even considering these factors, this result should be a large step to lead understanding other cultures.</p>

<p>In other participating schools&#8217; result more than a few Japanese students said &ldquo;No&rdquo; particularly. We think that the reason is related to the result of Question No. 1 and 2. And owing to few chance for them to make a personal friend, it was difficult for them to have an interest in partner&rsquo;s culture. To the contrary few American students chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We estimate that the American students had more interest in Japanese culture than Japanese students who spend everyday life flooded with American culture.</p>

<p>The truth that there were students who answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; is an important issue. And it suggests that the international exchange programs in the Teenage Walkers Project should be necessarily improved.</p>

1. Foods and school life<br/>
2. I felt difference that people talked each other even between boys and girls or high school students and middle students in America.<br/>
3. They had a different idea about driver license and a mobile telephone<br/>
4. Customs about taking a bath and the procedure<br/>
5. Generous hospitality and kindness<br/>
6. I had an interest that many our out fashion music were in fashion in Japan.</p>

<p>This question was set to determine how much interest in partner&rsquo;s culture participating students had and whether they could take a good start for communication with the result through the basic four exchange programs.</p>

<p>It is difficult for international exchange to overcome the truth that culturally common and different parts exist when you compare your own culture with partner&rsquo;s one. When you try to communicate with persons who belong to other culture, if there is totally no common things between you, it is hard for you to have good contact with them. To the contrary if no difference exists, the necessity of communication decrease like hart to hart understanding without a word. It means cultural difference to a certain extent is essential for the start of communication. Because the difference will produce a topic to begin communication exchange.</p>

<p>The answer to this question in Toshi Middle School is that 14 students chose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 8 ones &ldquo;A little&rdquo;, 8 others &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The ratio of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is more than others but the answers were separated widely. Some students did not feel difference from American culture. On the other hand as compared with the result of Toshi Middle School, in Guilford County Schools 15 American students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 2 ones &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and no one &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This result indicates that they grasped differences from Japanese culture and were intrigued with them. We estimate that the way of accepting partner&rsquo;s culture would be definitely varied between the Japanese students living together with flooded American culture and the American students with not much Japanese culture.</p>

<p>This question set up space in which the students could write what kind of things actually they had an interest in. And some examples are above for your reference.</p>

<p>In other participating schools a similar result appeared. The answers of the Japanese students to the question separated widely and a large number of &ldquo;No&rdquo;. On the other hand almost all American students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and few &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p>

1. McDonalds and Nike bland shoes<br/>
2. Japanese students were taking foods almost as same as ours.<br/>
3. When I asked about a party, it was interesting to know what they were doing was almost as same as ours unexpectedly.<br/>
4. Famous Japanese TV programs was on air in America with different titles. And popular American artists.<br/>
5. Favorite movies like Titanic, music and recreations</p>

<p>This question is opposite from previous Question No. 7. As we explained the relationship between cultural difference and communication in Question No. 7, cultural difference create interest in partner&rsquo;s culture and a start of communication and cultural commonality produce affinity for sharing coincident matters. The affinity will be media to shorten psychological distance between students and lead to deepen communication among them. Like a chicken or egg question, we can not give a right answer to whether cultural difference or commonality should be first necessary for communication among different cultures. Both of them should be indispensable for the early stage of international communication exchange.</p>

<p>In the answers to the question of Toshi Middle School a half of the students said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We guess that they did not feel much difference in American culture which prevailed in Japanese society. Many American students in Guilford County Schools chose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and a few of them did &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This result indicated that the American students felt more interest in cultural matters than the Japanese students.</p>

<p>This question also set up space in which the students could write what kind of things actually they had an interest in. We introduced some examples which both countries students wrote above for your reference.</p>

<p>In other participating schools there was a gap between the American and Japanese result. Many &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the Japanese schools on the other hand a lot of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the American schools.</p>

1. music, movies, hair style, TV programs, sports, life style, school and so on<br/>
2. speaking a regional dialect<br/>
3. about our island and regional events<br/>
4. foods, life style and traditional arts<br/>
5. what we are living in everyday life</p>

<p>This question determined how much participating students could introduce their own culture to their partners contrary to Question No. 5, 6, 7?and 8 which asked how much they had an interest in partner&rsquo;s culture.</p>

<p>The basic programs like Current Trend Introduction or Area Introduction held in the early stage of international activities contained aim to set up a chance for participating students not only to understand partner&rsquo;s culture but also to review own culture through international exchange. Even common things in everyday life likely reflect differently on a person who belongs to another culture. In the early exchange programs we expected that the students could reevaluate their own culture which their partners looked at in a new light. Understanding international exchange by taking a broad view of things on the premise of international society is important. On the other hand it also needs for communication exchange among different cultures to understand own culture and introduce it to partners. Though this question set up with the aim, we doubt how much the students could understand the aim considering their age. We think that they simply answered the question by how much they could introduce their culture quantitatively.</p>

<p>As the result of the question 16 students in Toshi Middle School answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 11 ones &ldquo;A little&rdquo;. Generally they could introduce their own culture. In Guilford County Schools the number of each answer was almost same. A specific feature between both countries&#8217; result is that the ratio of &ldquo;No&rdquo; in Guilford County Schools was more than in Toshi Middle School. We think that the Japanese students made School and Area Introduction home pages by themselves on the other hand teachers of the American students did the jobs instead of them caused influence on the specific feature. The entity of international activities in Guilford County Schools was divided by plural high schools so that they could not contact with each other smoothly to progress the group activities.</p>

<p>The result of other participating schools was that the ratio of &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; increased in number more than &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on the Japanese side and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in number was more than other answers on the American side. The tendency of this result was different from the one between Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools. We guess the reason is that the American students made the home pages by themselves and introduced their own culture through live video conference programs too.</p>

<p>The samples of what kind of culture the students of both countries introduced are there above for your reference.</p>

<p>Many students in Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Almost all students had an experience to visit partner&rsquo;s country and spent a nice time with together. It is natural to think that they wanted to visit again. On the other hand we do not exactly why some students chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. But considering the result of next Question No. 12 which asked the students if they want to accept partners in their home again was that no one of both countries answered &ldquo;No&rdquo;, the students answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; in this question had no discontent with their partners. We guess that they could not get used to travel abroad or wanted to visit other countries without America or Japan.</p>

<p>Almost all American students in other participating schools wanted to visit Japan and only one chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. As same as the result of Question No. 6 they seemed to have an interest in Japanese culture and an strong desire to go to Japan. In the result of other Japanese participating schools it is interesting that many students in Maryknoll Girls&#8217; School said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. We think the reason why some of them had already experienced to visit abroad before.</p>

<p>As compared with the previous Question No. 10 asked whether students wanted to visit partner&rsquo;s country or not, it seems almost same but this question asked what kind of impression on home stays the students have.</p>

<p>23 students in Toshi Middle School answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and 5 &ldquo;A little&rdquo; followed. 80 percent of the students from the ratio of answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; seemed satisfied the home stay program held in America August 1998. Unfortunately some students said &ldquo;No&rdquo; as same as Question No. 10. Not only staying abroad is enjoyable but also it requests certain burdens to overcome communication problem and different life style. They seemed not to have a good memory of the homestay.</p>

<p>On the other hand almost all students in Guilford County Schools including the result of 14 &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and 3 &ldquo;A little&rdquo; enjoyed themselves in the home stay held in Japan January 1999. No one answered &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In other participating schools a large gap was appeared between Japanese schools and American schools. Though the result was separated widely, some students on the Japanese side chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. On the other hand the ratio of answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on the American side was high and a few &ldquo;A little&rdquo;. Other participating schools did not open home stay programs like between Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools. Without some students in Maryknoll Girls&#8217; School many of the students had never experienced to visit another county. We expected to realize home stay programs by other participating schools too. But it was difficult for them to do it financially or due to different school system.</p>

<p>We hope that the students of other schools can implement home stay programs individually in the future. But in reality it still seems hard for them to go abroad for homestays as they wish though the price of airplane ticket decreased.</p>

<p>This question asked whether the students want homestays or not regardless of actual implementation. But some students who answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; might think that they can not do it by themselves.</p>

<h4>Q.12: Do you want to accept your partners if they want to stay in your home in the future?</h4>

<p>This question determined if participating students could accept their partners in their home in contrast to Question No. 11 which asked if they wanted to visit their partner&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p>Many students in Toshi Middle School answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and a few &ldquo;A little&rdquo;. There was no student chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The result is obviously different from the one of Question No. 10 and 11 which included some students said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We guess that the students said &ldquo;No&rdquo; wanted to accept their partners instead of going abroad. As long as they stay in Japan, they can communicate with their partners in comfortable environment which they know well and are not required an environmental adoption. In Guilford County Schools a lot of students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and none of them &ldquo;No&rdquo; as followed with Question No. 11.</p>

<p>There was not answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; means that every students&#8217; families can accept partners again. We expect that they will extend more individual communication exchange from now on. And it also means that the twice home stay programs worked well.</p>

<p>In other participating schools, the result was different from the one of Question No. 11. The ratio of answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the Japanese schools decreased. As same as Toshi Middle School we think if a communication exchange condition is comfortable for them, the Japanese students want to meet their partners directly. We can understand well their feeling to request safe environment to communicate with their partner though it seems passive commitment to international exchange. We think through direct communication exchange if they can deepen their friendship they will start to visit their countries or homes each other sooner or later.</p>

<p>Free description
1. I would like to continue communication exchange through the Internet and especially homestays.<br/>
2. From now on I will communicate with more people directly for building human relationship.<br/>
3. I want to discuss with a variety of people through Bulletin Board.<br/>
4. Not through live video conference system I would like to meet and talk with my partners directly.<br/>
5. I want to extend friendship with more people.</p>

<p>This question asked what kind of impression on Teenage Walkers Project participating students had. The actual impressions on the project was gathered in the result of later question. We collected quantitatively the sum of their impressions with answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Probably&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this question.</p>

<p>Answers &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; selected by 25 students in Toshi Middle School got a majority. &ldquo;A little &rdquo; chosen by 2 ones. &ldquo;No&rdquo; picked by 3 of them. The result of this question suggested that 80 percent of the students seemed satisfied the activities in the Teenage Walkers Project. As an experimental project for international activities with the Internet we can say this project was well done.</p>

<p>On the other hand all students selected &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in Guilford County Schools. This result means Teenage Walkers Project was evaluated well too on the American side.</p>

<p>In other participating schools the results between American and Japanese schools was varied each other. There were many students chose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, a few &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and none of them &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the American side. On the other hand the ratio of &ldquo;Probably&rdquo; increased and some of them said &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the Japanese side. As compared with the international activities between Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools, the communication exchange period was shorter and there was no home stay program in other participating schools. Considering these conditions some of the Japanese students was not satisfied well international activities only on the Internet.</p>

<p>We feel regret that the evaluation of Teenage Walkers Project by the Japanese students was a little lower. On the other hand the American students thought highly of the project and wished to continue it. We do not know exactly why the gap happened because we did not examine it thoroughly. As far as we can estimate each participating school had own arrangement and support system for the international activities that caused the gap.</p>

<h4>Q.14: What was your most favorite activity in the Teenage Walkers Project?</h4>

<p>Students who participated in Teenage Walkers Project could write their most favorite activities freely. Some sample answers which the students actually wrote down was below for your reference.</p>

<p>Generally a live video conference program was most popular in every participating schools. From the first the program was well received so that we can easily predict the result. A shocking scene of real-time live movies and sounds of partners crossing over the border is similar to a future TV telephone. Opening a communication activity with this live video conference system produced precious opportunities for every students in both countries to know each other.</p>

<p>Just one month before conducting this questionnaire a home stay program was held between Guilford County Schools and Toshi Middle School so that many American students chose the visit in Japan as their most enjoyable activity. It is interesting to see that some students wrote their experience in Japan like eating Japanese food, wearing Kimono or spending a nice time with their host family.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Process to Implement Programs</h3>

<p>The activity program of Teenage Walkers Project is divided into seven steps. It expects to follow a reasonable process that each participant and area can cooperate with together to widen the circle of exchange according to achievement of the steps. Each of the steps has an objective and program. Participants can come up the steps one by one. But there is no order to follow the steps correctly. We assume that they can flexibly advance their walk proportionately according to their demand and ability to implement each step.</p>

<p>They do not need to pay too much attention to the programs prepared in each step. If one participating school has already experienced international exchange before, they can start from the third or fourth step. Of course they can also follow from the first. The most important point of the activity program is to lead the way to the project&rsquo;s aim, that of: &quot;Making a friend overseas whose name and face you know&quot;.</p>

<p>But children who are a novice at international communication exchange will be perplexed if they are asked to start individual communication with foreigners from tomorrow. It has meaning to progress the exchange activities, little by little, cultivating their international sense and communication ability to understand different cultures. The reason why we divided the activity program by seven steps.</p>

<p>As to the explanation for the steps and the programs, The objective of <A name="label1">the first step</A> &quot;Get to know each other&quot; is the beginning of communication and an inevitable pass to start human relationship. What this step requires is that participants can definitely recognize and feel the existence of their partners abroad. The step should be certainly achieved for international exchange on the Internet. If we try to build human relationship in cyberspace where there is no physical contact, it is quite important for developing the relationship to obtain knowledge and information about their partners and partner&rsquo;s lifestyle as much as possible. In consideration of communication methods developed in human history, communication without physical contact does not have much experienced background yet. If we begin communication with less information on partners, we will feel uncertain even in the real world. Though in some cases marriage has occurred between couples that met each other on the Internet but had never directly seen one another.</p>

<p>Therefore four programs are assembled to accomplish the objective of the first step &quot;Get to know each other&quot;. Self-Introduction, Current Trend Introduction, School Introduction and Area Introduction programs prepare for the step we suppose that participants can gradually take from introducing themselves to lifestyles around them. We hope that achievement of the first step &quot;Get to know each other&quot; will lead to the next step objective &quot;Learn the cultural backgrounds of each other&quot; gradually. We do not set up a specific point to divide between the first and second step.</p>

<p>In <A name="label2">the second step</A> we assume that participants can discover that common and different cultures should exist in everyday life through the activities to gather and compare information around their life with each other. Cultivating the sense to adopt cultural commonality and difference is very useful for improving communication ability to understand other cultures. And the meaning and the pleasure of activities of international communication exchange should exist in there.</p>

<p>Though the Self-Introduction program as a first activity in the four programs seems ordinary, as we mentioned above, without getting to know each other and exchanging basic cultural information we suppose that it is harder to guide individual communication exchange. In this program participants will introduce their basic information like their name with photo and their interests in movies, music and sports in the form of a home page.  Introducing themselves will not impose many burdens on participants because they can easily collect the information related to themselves. For example, if you get mail and are asked by somebody whom you do not know well to gather data on acid rain around your local area for surveying the destruction of the environment, it seems an undesirable
start for first communication exchange though you can collect the data and agree to the purpose of the activity. If the same question is asked in real life, you will be confused and never feel familiar with the questioner.</p>

<p>To introduce myself enough in international exchange is very important to build a friendship overcoming cultural differences. The same thing should be said in communication exchange on the Internet. If a friendship is built without this process, it will be likely in trouble of serious cultural conflicts even when small misunderstanding may happen. In the case of the activity on the Internet, you maybe be able to turn off your computer and never go back to communication with your partner when you face an unfavorable situation for yourself. Some people evaluate the easiness of this kind of communication positively. We think that the evaluation is based on a superficial human relationship and seems to have been no effort to move forward for understanding with other cultures. The first step to get over cultural differences should be taken through talking with each other. Describing myself will also provide participants an opportunity for self-expression. They will have another look at themselves through it. This is another important point in the Self-Introduction program.</p>

<p>The Current Trend Introduction Program is prepared as a sequel to the Self-Introduction. This program aims to gather and exchange information on what is getting popular in participating areas or schools not in their countries. Working together with the previous program, the information collected through Self-Introduction will be arranged and calculated to find the tendency for preference among participants. We expect that this approach will reveal popular trends familiar to participants and exchanging this live cultural information will stimulate interest in international communication exchange among participants. For a long time, overseas news has been reported only by the mass media and we have not been able to obtain enough information about foreign countries because the quantity of the information has been limited by, for example, certain allowed space for international issues in newspapers. We have to guess the outer world with limited information which has resulted in creating cultural stereotypes. But if we can obtain much of the latest information about other countries not only from the mass media but also through individual connections, a new way of looking at overseas countries will be provided even if the personal information may be less reliable than that produced by the mass media because of a lack of verification. We think that this viewpoint will work in leading to the overthrow of cultural stereotypes.</p>

<p>The School Introduction program is carried out after the Current Trend Introduction. From this program the objective of the second step &quot;Learn the cultural backgrounds of each other&quot; will start gradually.  According to its title this program is presumed to be done by participating schools. If other forms of entities participate in this project, it can be replaced in schools with the main organization or groups. Some students would think that introducing their school seems uninteresting and worthless to show, but many differences should be observed among schools in other countries. Not only differences as to custom or system but also relationships between students and teachers or students will be exposed. The style of schools will differ clearly from each other because they were designed to match the regional environment. Each school should have its own comparable culture which seems uninteresting for students in the same culture. Through discovering even a little difference, it will increase interest in other cultures. For example, a door in a school, mainly the type with a knob or to slide open are popular in Japan but in America we can see one with a bar to push set on the middle of the door frequently because fire personnel can open it efficiently and speedily if a fire happens in school. Even by comparing a tiny and uninteresting door we can learn unique ideas and cultural backgrounds exist there. We presume that making use of school and everyday life subjects will produce a chance to let participants enjoy discovering new cultural things.</p>

<p>The last program is Area Introduction program.  In the same as the School Introduction this program is to appeal to their residential area where participants live from their point of view. Though area introduction may tend to show traditional cultures in the area, it should be done by information based on everyday life around the participants. For example, even where heritage cultures or histories have already been abandoned in newly developed residential areas, they can introduce their ordinary life like with photos taken of crowded streets or of their modern houses, high buildings and so on. They maybe feel hesitant about showing the kind of things which have no historical value. But people in other cultures will have other viewpoints about them because of different life styles. Common scenes for them may be reflected like another world to persons who belong to other cultures. As a good example, you can often watch foreign tourists take many pictures of houses and streets which are ordinary for the residents. If traditional culture or historical backgrounds still exist, they can introduce the culture positively. Even if it is too old to show, they will become aware of the current situation of their local culture and encourage a re-assessment of that culture by exhibiting it internationally. In this program, to observe even a tiny thing is important. Finding a small difference in international exchange among different cultures will improve understanding of partners&#8217; cultures.</p>

<p>Through the above four programs we expect that the first step objective &quot;Get to know each other&quot; and the second step one &quot;Learn the cultural backgrounds of each other&quot; will be accomplished.  Participants will experience ascertaining existence of their partners at first, exchanging cultural information around their everyday life and discovering common and different cultures among them. These experiences from each step will let them become familiar with international communication exchange. Participants can arrange these basic programs of their own free will. The meaning which the objectives of the two steps have is very important.  Without the complement of the objectives, it is difficult to realize individual communication exchange which the Teenage Walkers Project pursues.</p>

<p>When &quot;Get to know each other&quot; and &quot;Learn the cultural backgrounds of each other&quot; are achieved the next step is waiting. The objective of <A name="label3">the third step</A> is &quot;Form a network-orientated community&quot;. We aim that activities by group will be promoted with experience and knowledge obtained in the last two steps. Though it is up to the form in which the participating 5 or 6 members in one group will be comprised, each group can decide the theme, and conduct study and presentation of activities as they like.  For example, more advanced study to research the subjects which have been picked up in School and Area Introduction as an extension of the basic programs and opening an art exhibition or Exposition on the Internet, a variety of activities can be realized starting with ideas from participants. This step has a feature to produce the possibility for participants to obtain international information directly from cooperative activities with partner groups. The relationship has already been established through the basic programs and the knowledge of cultural backgrounds also has already been exchanged with each other so that participants can easily get enough information for the group activities.  We expect that a network-orientated community will be formed through the group activities.  Participants can feel the community as a network based on human relationships which produce requested information promptly. For the next step after building the community, we hope that individual communication exchanges will increase inside the community. The activities by groups is predicted to raise personal contacts in the community spontaneously.</p>

<p><A name="label4">The fourth step</A> aims to expand the group activities into individual ones. In this step &quot;Make an intimate relationship&quot; should be realized as the objective and participants can enjoy individual communication exchange freely in the community built through the third step. The role of the community which participants feel familiar with is important and the condition to promote individual activities in this step is how much they share the common feeling of the community. The contents of the activities depend on participants the same as the group ones and they can carry out and conduct study or expression activities as they wish.</p>

<p>The contact system to support the individual activities like E-mail or Bulletin board should be established in advance. Not only usage of the Internet technology but also common communication methods like a letter and fax will be available. Even exchanging everyday life news by E-mails or messages on the Bulletin Board is enough for the activities.  The principal issue is to evolve individual communication and build a friendship between participants.</p>

<p>In <A name="label5">the fifth step</A> &quot;Enhancement of exchange&quot; through events and forums which all of the participants can join in should be accomplished as the objective, for example, opening an Exposition on the Internet which exhibits the results of past activities or forums to discuss certain subjects with all participants. The activities shall be opened publicly and people from outside without regular participants also can observe or join in them. The previous programs have a tendency to build a closed community in which participants can communicate with each other. But the programs in this fifth step can invite new people to join in communication exchange openly from outside of the community. We predict that opening the community can produce new cultural experience and accelerate communication exchange. The prior matter in this step is that the sense of a community and tight human relationship has already been built among participants in advance. If events or forums are held without this premise, they may make a temporary relationship but it is difficult to expect long term friendship from the activities. If a steady base of communication exchange does not exist, the short period relationship will be over at the end of the events.</p>

<p>Many kinds of actual activities will be realized resulting from participants ideas. They can make use of the property which they created before like their home page or bulletin board communication. And if the technical condition is set up, we strongly recommend realizing a live video conference on the Internet.  The technical system is composed of a computer in which is installed the software for the live video conference, a small CCD camera and a microphone. It will work like a future video phone exchanging real-time voice and movies through the Internet. The activities with this system cause a drastic impact and
make it possible to exchange an enormous quantity of information as compared with other communication activities so that it will enlarge the sense of affinity to partners at once. If the technical system can be prepared, we expect that the live video conference, which will lead to intimate communication and develop the sense of a community, should be opened in early stages.</p>

<p>Though the live video conference has a great possibility as an ideal communication model, it also has a couple of disadvantages. Because the technology of the live video conference system itself is under development, enough knowledge to build the system into the computer is required and even after installing it the repetitious maintenance and adjustment for the system is also needed. Using the Internet for this system can make the communication expenses cheap, on the other hand, sending voice or movies from partners will be delayed or sometimes never accomplished because the connection between two live video conference overseas may be affected by congestion of international phone circuits. The live video conference system is improving day by day and sooner or later more advanced and comfortable technology will be innovated. But the circuits for the Internet depend on universal network infrastructures. Still the problem will remain for a while.</p>

<p>The result of the activities in the Teenage Walkers Project should be concluded from when participants can achieve the aim: &quot;Making a friend overseas whose name and face you know&quot;. Direct communication exchange which is basic and existing human communication style is the best way to accomplish the aim.  Meeting with partners face to face is the most desirable for international exchange even using a computer and the Internet called Computer Mediated Communications Technology for exchange activities. In reality it is yet impossible to go abroad for home stays frequently though many people can visit in other countries with discounted airplane tickets. Maybe in the future direct communication will be done easily. To know about partners in advance and understand their culture profoundly is still a prior matter for communication exchange among different cultures. International exchange with Internet technology is valid and the Internet itself is useful in this way. But it is not too much to say that direct communication is the real pleasure of international
communication exchange.</p>

<p>In <A name="label6">the sixth step</A> &quot;Promoting direct exchange&quot; is held up as the objective. We guess that it is hard financially to realize direct communication.  And to achieve the sixth step is our hope. But we strongly recommend that direct communication like a home stay program should be planed in consideration of the basic concept and objectives. It is easy to forecast that if to have experience of meeting partners directly or not will make a large difference in the strength of the bonds of human relationship.  It is possible to make a friendship on the Internet and sometimes easy to do it as compared with in the real life. But some people indicated that the relationship established on the Internet is fragile. The reason why is that if something which is capable to break the friendship happens, turning off the computer will be the easiest way to avoid the trouble.  Friendship which we expect through the Teenage Walkers Project is not the thing like that based on a breakable human relationship. We think that using the Internet is similar to a double edged sword. The delicate relationship on the Internet may tend to lead to miscommunication.  Unless enough effort to settle the problem is done, the broken relationship will easily create cultural stereotypes or invite serious misunderstanding among different cultures.</p>

<p>From the viewpoint of making a friendship direct communication is the best way. But it also has the other side like the Internet.  To open the way to implement direct communication requires enough preparation and cost. And face to face level communication needs to pay much attention to not only their language but also partners nonverbal communication like their gestures or acts. This nonverbal communication based on one&rsquo;s culture and custom asks much effort to learn and understand it. In some cases the image of partners will alter the one on the Internet when you meet them directly. In the real world you can get more information about partners which has never been transferred through the screen of a computer. If you can overcome a barrier of cultural difference between you and partners which was built by direct communication, the future exchange activities will make rapid progress. And even some cultural miscommunication might happen. But if you know each other well you can cope with the problem flexibly.  From the other viewpoint of understanding other cultures direct communication has a significance to be realized.</p>

<p>&quot;Expansion of international exchange&quot; which is the objective for <A name="label7">the seventh step</A> is a final and ideal stage to go to. We expect that participants themselves who have already experienced communication exchange until the sixth step will take over the role of widening the circle of exchange to other regions. Especially participants in areas where exchange activities are well developed should cooperate and support exchange programs in other areas where internationalization and information technology are not so developed due to social or economic causes. Teenage Walkers Project take a strong stand on cultural equality among different countries or regions even though a disparity in economic power exists among them. Extending the circle of exchange will increase opportunities to appeal to regional cultures worldwide which have not been introduced much until now because of social and economic reasons. Introducing regional cultures which are not known well will stimulate existing well known cultures and lead to currency of motive power to yield new ones. It will also further mutual understanding and co-existence with other cultures. International communication exchange between nations tends to place an emphasis on the economy but communication exchange among citizens can fulfill cultural progress.</p>

<p>In this seventh step we do not assume that widening the circle of exchange will be achieved only through the activities of the Teenage Walkers Project. We think cooperation with other organizations or groups which support international exchange for the purpose is required. Expanding individual communication exchange together with other organizations will naturally realize the idea of mutual understanding and co-existence with other cultures and find a way to reach international peace. If you know your partners overseas well, it may be hard to fight against them.  For a long time wars under nation state systems
happened among unknown persons. There were symbolic phrases like: &quot;Fiendish American and the British with demon faces&quot; or &quot;Yellow monkey against the Japanese&quot;. In the Second World War there were few personal relationships between fighters on each side which created exaggerated or wrong information about each other judged from their semblance. If more relationships had existed, human history would have been changed. Though drastic revolution has happened in the field of aeronautical transport engineering and information technology, few people could go abroad until recently.  This kind of thought has been regarded as a utopian idea. But once we face the technical possibility to be in the age of individual communication exchange, the idea is getting to have more reality. Technology itself is not the main point to deal with. The task which we need to overcome will be reforming human recognition or perception of the possibility of the new international communication exchange. For example, suddenly impossibilities are no longer impossible and you can understand it in your head but can not or will be reluctant to accept it consciously. Trials to reform the human recognition are also included in the experimental activities in the Teenage Walkers Project.</p>

<p>As a result to achieve the aim &quot;Making a friend overseas whose name and face you know&quot; we provide the general structure of communication exchange programs divided by seven steps. Actually it is not easy to complete individual communication exchange and it is a burden and hard work. And understanding the other cultures also needs much time to accomplish so that it is important to advance it little by little with enriched communication activities.</p>

<p>Lastly we assume that the general structure of communication exchange programs is not the best plan and needs to be improved constantly with feed back of the result and state of communication activities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Details of Activity Program</h3>

<p>[Activities at First and Second Stages]<br/>
(Self-Introduction Program)<br/>
This program offers opportunities for the participating students to get to know each other through the preparation of self-introductory homepages and also provides an initial opportunity for communication and presentation activities.</p>

<p>Sample Case</p>

<p>(Current Trend Introduction Program)<br/>
Participating students will organize the results of surveys on interesting things and new trends, summarize them by item, and exhibit them on their homepage. Through this exhibition, they will understand some of the survey items that are common to different areas. These common items should provide ideas for communication. They will also understand that different cultures still exist and introduce these features. This will encourage the students to show an interest in cultural exchange.</p>

<p>(Exchange Exhibition Program by Individuals)<br/>
The next stage of the group exchange offers an opportunity for a member to select a partner for joint study and presentation activities in another school based on their own particular interests. The results of this joint activity could also be exhibited. Through this program, members should find a friend for long-term international exchange and benefit from the strength of the international community.  They may be able to publicize their activities globally, if the exhibition achieves successful results. The tools for this program will be a home page or bulletin board.</p>

<p><A href="bulletin.htm">Sample Activity</A></p>

<p>[Activities at Fifth Stage]<br/>
(Exchange Exhibition Program by School)<br/>
By Event<br/>
Each School organizes events to provide an opportunity for exchange and exhibitions.  All of the members of the class decide on the event program. An event may be in the style of an &lsquo;exposition&rsquo;, where groups exhibit the results jointly. The tools for this program will be a home page or live video conference system.</p>

<p>By Forum<br/>
A forum will be organized to provide exchange and study activities by school. The forum program should be decided by all of the school.  Results of the individual study theme can possibly become the school theme. The tools for this program will be a live video conference system.</p>

<p><A href="lvc.htm">Sample Activity</A></p>

<p>[Activities at Sixth Stage]<br/>
(Direct Exchange Program)<br/>
Both partners can meet and conduct direct exchange like homestay after getting to know each other through the network. This will promote a deeper understanding of different cultures and encourage long-term exchange.</p>

<p>[Activities at Seventh Stage]<br/>
(Area Exchange Support Program)<br/>
As a result of the previous stages, participating students can conduct PR supporting activities for international exchanges. Participants in areas where exchange activities are well developed should support exchange programs in other areas where internationalization and information technology are not so developed. Examples of these activities include charity appeals and donation activities and any other action program in which they can participate.  Hopefully, these activities may be upgraded to GII, where the citizens can participate directly. The ultimate objective of the Teenage Walkers Project, i.e., international exchange covering different areas of the world for the promotion of further cultural development among the international community, should be achieved by this program.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Basic Concept and the Project&rsquo;s Objectives</h3>

<p>[Basic Concept]<br/>
The basic concept of the Teenage Walkers Project is to offer international exchange opportunities to teenagers around the world by means of information networks, in order to further mutual understanding and co-existence with other cultures in the international community.</p>

<p>[The Project&rsquo;s Objectives]<br/>
The Teenage Walkers Project has four objectives to achieve to compensate the basic concept.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It offers support for a network-orientated community to the children of the world by means of information and communications technology i.e., the Internet.</p></li>
<li><p>It also encourages further cultural development among the international community through the exchange of local cultures all over the world.</p></li>
<li><p>It offers actual cultural exchanges like home stay programs which enhance further cultural exchange by developing network communities.</p></li>
<li><p>Through our Teenage Walkers project, we will enhance our role of promoting international peace by supporting exchange projects in areas that are unable to carry out internationalization activities by themselves or maintain their own information technology.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Background</h3>

<p>The basic concept of the Teenage Walkers Project is to offer international exchange opportunities to teenagers around the world by means of information networks, in order to further mutual understanding and co-existence with other cultures in the international community. <BR></p>

<p>We has already stepped into the age of the Internet spreading worldwide rapidly and been asked a question as to how to use the new technology for our social benefit. As one answer to the question the project will propose the novel idea to support international communication exchange through making the best use of the borderless network system.</p>

<p>Cultural exchanges is enlarging in the international society as well as the Internet. It is extending not only ordinary oversea sightseeing but also individual communication exchange like study abroad or home stay in a foreign family.</p>

<p>This current situation appears an alternative perspective of a distance between individual and the world or everyday life and the international society like the phrase of Shrinking World.</p>

<p>Exchanging or encountering among different cultures are increasing, on the other hand a reality reveals that mutual understanding and co-existence with other cultures is not expanding simultaneously. Increasing contacts among different cultures sometimes bears friction like regional conflicts or racial prejudice against immigrants. Individual communication exchange also face a crisis of failure in contact to lead misunderstanding other cultures at all times.</p>

<p>Therefore the Teenage Walkers Project has an aim to discover a point of contact between two enormous currents of the Internet and exchanges among different cultures which has impacted drastically on the international society and convert them into one current for mutual understanding and co-existence with other cultures.</p>

<p>In this current we expect superior ability which teenagers possess to turn their eyes to forward to new things and other countries and accept cultural differences flexibly.  The project depends and bases on the ability.</p>

<p>Through the activities in the project teenagers around the world can understand other cultures profoundly and share the concept of co-existence among different cultures which will show the possibilities to overcome cultural differences and propose some ideas to settle the friction and conflicts to the world.</p>

<p>Co-existence among different cultures will stimulate our existing cultures to create new ones. Needless to say human history a culture is always modified by others and yield new ones. In the situation of constant stimulation from different cultures we hope the world develop and become more mature culturally.</p>
