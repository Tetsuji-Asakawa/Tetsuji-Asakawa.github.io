<div class="entry-content"><h3>Process to Implement Programs</h3>

<p>The activity program of Teenage Walkers Project is divided into seven steps. It expects to follow a reasonable process that each participant and area can cooperate with together to widen the circle of exchange according to achievement of the steps. Each of the steps has an objective and program. Participants can come up the steps one by one. But there is no order to follow the steps correctly. We assume that they can flexibly advance their walk proportionately according to their demand and ability to implement each step.</p>

<p>They do not need to pay too much attention to the programs prepared in each step. If one participating school has already experienced international exchange before, they can start from the third or fourth step. Of course they can also follow from the first. The most important point of the activity program is to lead the way to the project&rsquo;s aim, that of: &quot;Making a friend overseas whose name and face you know&quot;.</p>

<p>But children who are a novice at international communication exchange will be perplexed if they are asked to start individual communication with foreigners from tomorrow. It has meaning to progress the exchange activities, little by little, cultivating their international sense and communication ability to understand different cultures. The reason why we divided the activity program by seven steps.</p>

<p>As to the explanation for the steps and the programs, The objective of <A name="label1">the first step</A> &quot;Get to know each other&quot; is the beginning of communication and an inevitable pass to start human relationship. What this step requires is that participants can definitely recognize and feel the existence of their partners abroad. The step should be certainly achieved for international exchange on the Internet. If we try to build human relationship in cyberspace where there is no physical contact, it is quite important for developing the relationship to obtain knowledge and information about their partners and partner&rsquo;s lifestyle as much as possible. In consideration of communication methods developed in human history, communication without physical contact does not have much experienced background yet. If we begin communication with less information on partners, we will feel uncertain even in the real world. Though in some cases marriage has occurred between couples that met each other on the Internet but had never directly seen one another.</p>

<p>Therefore four programs are assembled to accomplish the objective of the first step &quot;Get to know each other&quot;. Self-Introduction, Current Trend Introduction, School Introduction and Area Introduction programs prepare for the step we suppose that participants can gradually take from introducing themselves to lifestyles around them. We hope that achievement of the first step &quot;Get to know each other&quot; will lead to the next step objective &quot;Learn the cultural backgrounds of each other&quot; gradually. We do not set up a specific point to divide between the first and second step.</p>

<p>In <A name="label2">the second step</A> we assume that participants can discover that common and different cultures should exist in everyday life through the activities to gather and compare information around their life with each other. Cultivating the sense to adopt cultural commonality and difference is very useful for improving communication ability to understand other cultures. And the meaning and the pleasure of activities of international communication exchange should exist in there.</p>

<p>Though the Self-Introduction program as a first activity in the four programs seems ordinary, as we mentioned above, without getting to know each other and exchanging basic cultural information we suppose that it is harder to guide individual communication exchange. In this program participants will introduce their basic information like their name with photo and their interests in movies, music and sports in the form of a home page.  Introducing themselves will not impose many burdens on participants because they can easily collect the information related to themselves. For example, if you get mail and are asked by somebody whom you do not know well to gather data on acid rain around your local area for surveying the destruction of the environment, it seems an undesirable
start for first communication exchange though you can collect the data and agree to the purpose of the activity. If the same question is asked in real life, you will be confused and never feel familiar with the questioner.</p>

<p>To introduce myself enough in international exchange is very important to build a friendship overcoming cultural differences. The same thing should be said in communication exchange on the Internet. If a friendship is built without this process, it will be likely in trouble of serious cultural conflicts even when small misunderstanding may happen. In the case of the activity on the Internet, you maybe be able to turn off your computer and never go back to communication with your partner when you face an unfavorable situation for yourself. Some people evaluate the easiness of this kind of communication positively. We think that the evaluation is based on a superficial human relationship and seems to have been no effort to move forward for understanding with other cultures. The first step to get over cultural differences should be taken through talking with each other. Describing myself will also provide participants an opportunity for self-expression. They will have another look at themselves through it. This is another important point in the Self-Introduction program.</p>

<p>The Current Trend Introduction Program is prepared as a sequel to the Self-Introduction. This program aims to gather and exchange information on what is getting popular in participating areas or schools not in their countries. Working together with the previous program, the information collected through Self-Introduction will be arranged and calculated to find the tendency for preference among participants. We expect that this approach will reveal popular trends familiar to participants and exchanging this live cultural information will stimulate interest in international communication exchange among participants. For a long time, overseas news has been reported only by the mass media and we have not been able to obtain enough information about foreign countries because the quantity of the information has been limited by, for example, certain allowed space for international issues in newspapers. We have to guess the outer world with limited information which has resulted in creating cultural stereotypes. But if we can obtain much of the latest information about other countries not only from the mass media but also through individual connections, a new way of looking at overseas countries will be provided even if the personal information may be less reliable than that produced by the mass media because of a lack of verification. We think that this viewpoint will work in leading to the overthrow of cultural stereotypes.</p>

<p>The School Introduction program is carried out after the Current Trend Introduction. From this program the objective of the second step &quot;Learn the cultural backgrounds of each other&quot; will start gradually.  According to its title this program is presumed to be done by participating schools. If other forms of entities participate in this project, it can be replaced in schools with the main organization or groups. Some students would think that introducing their school seems uninteresting and worthless to show, but many differences should be observed among schools in other countries. Not only differences as to custom or system but also relationships between students and teachers or students will be exposed. The style of schools will differ clearly from each other because they were designed to match the regional environment. Each school should have its own comparable culture which seems uninteresting for students in the same culture. Through discovering even a little difference, it will increase interest in other cultures. For example, a door in a school, mainly the type with a knob or to slide open are popular in Japan but in America we can see one with a bar to push set on the middle of the door frequently because fire personnel can open it efficiently and speedily if a fire happens in school. Even by comparing a tiny and uninteresting door we can learn unique ideas and cultural backgrounds exist there. We presume that making use of school and everyday life subjects will produce a chance to let participants enjoy discovering new cultural things.</p>

<p>The last program is Area Introduction program.  In the same as the School Introduction this program is to appeal to their residential area where participants live from their point of view. Though area introduction may tend to show traditional cultures in the area, it should be done by information based on everyday life around the participants. For example, even where heritage cultures or histories have already been abandoned in newly developed residential areas, they can introduce their ordinary life like with photos taken of crowded streets or of their modern houses, high buildings and so on. They maybe feel hesitant about showing the kind of things which have no historical value. But people in other cultures will have other viewpoints about them because of different life styles. Common scenes for them may be reflected like another world to persons who belong to other cultures. As a good example, you can often watch foreign tourists take many pictures of houses and streets which are ordinary for the residents. If traditional culture or historical backgrounds still exist, they can introduce the culture positively. Even if it is too old to show, they will become aware of the current situation of their local culture and encourage a re-assessment of that culture by exhibiting it internationally. In this program, to observe even a tiny thing is important. Finding a small difference in international exchange among different cultures will improve understanding of partners&#8217; cultures.</p>

<p>Through the above four programs we expect that the first step objective &quot;Get to know each other&quot; and the second step one &quot;Learn the cultural backgrounds of each other&quot; will be accomplished.  Participants will experience ascertaining existence of their partners at first, exchanging cultural information around their everyday life and discovering common and different cultures among them. These experiences from each step will let them become familiar with international communication exchange. Participants can arrange these basic programs of their own free will. The meaning which the objectives of the two steps have is very important.  Without the complement of the objectives, it is difficult to realize individual communication exchange which the Teenage Walkers Project pursues.</p>

<p>When &quot;Get to know each other&quot; and &quot;Learn the cultural backgrounds of each other&quot; are achieved the next step is waiting. The objective of <A name="label3">the third step</A> is &quot;Form a network-orientated community&quot;. We aim that activities by group will be promoted with experience and knowledge obtained in the last two steps. Though it is up to the form in which the participating 5 or 6 members in one group will be comprised, each group can decide the theme, and conduct study and presentation of activities as they like.  For example, more advanced study to research the subjects which have been picked up in School and Area Introduction as an extension of the basic programs and opening an art exhibition or Exposition on the Internet, a variety of activities can be realized starting with ideas from participants. This step has a feature to produce the possibility for participants to obtain international information directly from cooperative activities with partner groups. The relationship has already been established through the basic programs and the knowledge of cultural backgrounds also has already been exchanged with each other so that participants can easily get enough information for the group activities.  We expect that a network-orientated community will be formed through the group activities.  Participants can feel the community as a network based on human relationships which produce requested information promptly. For the next step after building the community, we hope that individual communication exchanges will increase inside the community. The activities by groups is predicted to raise personal contacts in the community spontaneously.</p>

<p><A name="label4">The fourth step</A> aims to expand the group activities into individual ones. In this step &quot;Make an intimate relationship&quot; should be realized as the objective and participants can enjoy individual communication exchange freely in the community built through the third step. The role of the community which participants feel familiar with is important and the condition to promote individual activities in this step is how much they share the common feeling of the community. The contents of the activities depend on participants the same as the group ones and they can carry out and conduct study or expression activities as they wish.</p>

<p>The contact system to support the individual activities like E-mail or Bulletin board should be established in advance. Not only usage of the Internet technology but also common communication methods like a letter and fax will be available. Even exchanging everyday life news by E-mails or messages on the Bulletin Board is enough for the activities.  The principal issue is to evolve individual communication and build a friendship between participants.</p>

<p>In <A name="label5">the fifth step</A> &quot;Enhancement of exchange&quot; through events and forums which all of the participants can join in should be accomplished as the objective, for example, opening an Exposition on the Internet which exhibits the results of past activities or forums to discuss certain subjects with all participants. The activities shall be opened publicly and people from outside without regular participants also can observe or join in them. The previous programs have a tendency to build a closed community in which participants can communicate with each other. But the programs in this fifth step can invite new people to join in communication exchange openly from outside of the community. We predict that opening the community can produce new cultural experience and accelerate communication exchange. The prior matter in this step is that the sense of a community and tight human relationship has already been built among participants in advance. If events or forums are held without this premise, they may make a temporary relationship but it is difficult to expect long term friendship from the activities. If a steady base of communication exchange does not exist, the short period relationship will be over at the end of the events.</p>

<p>Many kinds of actual activities will be realized resulting from participants ideas. They can make use of the property which they created before like their home page or bulletin board communication. And if the technical condition is set up, we strongly recommend realizing a live video conference on the Internet.  The technical system is composed of a computer in which is installed the software for the live video conference, a small CCD camera and a microphone. It will work like a future video phone exchanging real-time voice and movies through the Internet. The activities with this system cause a drastic impact and
make it possible to exchange an enormous quantity of information as compared with other communication activities so that it will enlarge the sense of affinity to partners at once. If the technical system can be prepared, we expect that the live video conference, which will lead to intimate communication and develop the sense of a community, should be opened in early stages.</p>

<p>Though the live video conference has a great possibility as an ideal communication model, it also has a couple of disadvantages. Because the technology of the live video conference system itself is under development, enough knowledge to build the system into the computer is required and even after installing it the repetitious maintenance and adjustment for the system is also needed. Using the Internet for this system can make the communication expenses cheap, on the other hand, sending voice or movies from partners will be delayed or sometimes never accomplished because the connection between two live video conference overseas may be affected by congestion of international phone circuits. The live video conference system is improving day by day and sooner or later more advanced and comfortable technology will be innovated. But the circuits for the Internet depend on universal network infrastructures. Still the problem will remain for a while.</p>

<p>The result of the activities in the Teenage Walkers Project should be concluded from when participants can achieve the aim: &quot;Making a friend overseas whose name and face you know&quot;. Direct communication exchange which is basic and existing human communication style is the best way to accomplish the aim.  Meeting with partners face to face is the most desirable for international exchange even using a computer and the Internet called Computer Mediated Communications Technology for exchange activities. In reality it is yet impossible to go abroad for home stays frequently though many people can visit in other countries with discounted airplane tickets. Maybe in the future direct communication will be done easily. To know about partners in advance and understand their culture profoundly is still a prior matter for communication exchange among different cultures. International exchange with Internet technology is valid and the Internet itself is useful in this way. But it is not too much to say that direct communication is the real pleasure of international
communication exchange.</p>

<p>In <A name="label6">the sixth step</A> &quot;Promoting direct exchange&quot; is held up as the objective. We guess that it is hard financially to realize direct communication.  And to achieve the sixth step is our hope. But we strongly recommend that direct communication like a home stay program should be planed in consideration of the basic concept and objectives. It is easy to forecast that if to have experience of meeting partners directly or not will make a large difference in the strength of the bonds of human relationship.  It is possible to make a friendship on the Internet and sometimes easy to do it as compared with in the real life. But some people indicated that the relationship established on the Internet is fragile. The reason why is that if something which is capable to break the friendship happens, turning off the computer will be the easiest way to avoid the trouble.  Friendship which we expect through the Teenage Walkers Project is not the thing like that based on a breakable human relationship. We think that using the Internet is similar to a double edged sword. The delicate relationship on the Internet may tend to lead to miscommunication.  Unless enough effort to settle the problem is done, the broken relationship will easily create cultural stereotypes or invite serious misunderstanding among different cultures.</p>

<p>From the viewpoint of making a friendship direct communication is the best way. But it also has the other side like the Internet.  To open the way to implement direct communication requires enough preparation and cost. And face to face level communication needs to pay much attention to not only their language but also partners nonverbal communication like their gestures or acts. This nonverbal communication based on one&rsquo;s culture and custom asks much effort to learn and understand it. In some cases the image of partners will alter the one on the Internet when you meet them directly. In the real world you can get more information about partners which has never been transferred through the screen of a computer. If you can overcome a barrier of cultural difference between you and partners which was built by direct communication, the future exchange activities will make rapid progress. And even some cultural miscommunication might happen. But if you know each other well you can cope with the problem flexibly.  From the other viewpoint of understanding other cultures direct communication has a significance to be realized.</p>

<p>&quot;Expansion of international exchange&quot; which is the objective for <A name="label7">the seventh step</A> is a final and ideal stage to go to. We expect that participants themselves who have already experienced communication exchange until the sixth step will take over the role of widening the circle of exchange to other regions. Especially participants in areas where exchange activities are well developed should cooperate and support exchange programs in other areas where internationalization and information technology are not so developed due to social or economic causes. Teenage Walkers Project take a strong stand on cultural equality among different countries or regions even though a disparity in economic power exists among them. Extending the circle of exchange will increase opportunities to appeal to regional cultures worldwide which have not been introduced much until now because of social and economic reasons. Introducing regional cultures which are not known well will stimulate existing well known cultures and lead to currency of motive power to yield new ones. It will also further mutual understanding and co-existence with other cultures. International communication exchange between nations tends to place an emphasis on the economy but communication exchange among citizens can fulfill cultural progress.</p>

<p>In this seventh step we do not assume that widening the circle of exchange will be achieved only through the activities of the Teenage Walkers Project. We think cooperation with other organizations or groups which support international exchange for the purpose is required. Expanding individual communication exchange together with other organizations will naturally realize the idea of mutual understanding and co-existence with other cultures and find a way to reach international peace. If you know your partners overseas well, it may be hard to fight against them.  For a long time wars under nation state systems
happened among unknown persons. There were symbolic phrases like: &quot;Fiendish American and the British with demon faces&quot; or &quot;Yellow monkey against the Japanese&quot;. In the Second World War there were few personal relationships between fighters on each side which created exaggerated or wrong information about each other judged from their semblance. If more relationships had existed, human history would have been changed. Though drastic revolution has happened in the field of aeronautical transport engineering and information technology, few people could go abroad until recently.  This kind of thought has been regarded as a utopian idea. But once we face the technical possibility to be in the age of individual communication exchange, the idea is getting to have more reality. Technology itself is not the main point to deal with. The task which we need to overcome will be reforming human recognition or perception of the possibility of the new international communication exchange. For example, suddenly impossibilities are no longer impossible and you can understand it in your head but can not or will be reluctant to accept it consciously. Trials to reform the human recognition are also included in the experimental activities in the Teenage Walkers Project.</p>

<p>As a result to achieve the aim &quot;Making a friend overseas whose name and face you know&quot; we provide the general structure of communication exchange programs divided by seven steps. Actually it is not easy to complete individual communication exchange and it is a burden and hard work. And understanding the other cultures also needs much time to accomplish so that it is important to advance it little by little with enriched communication activities.</p>

<p>Lastly we assume that the general structure of communication exchange programs is not the best plan and needs to be improved constantly with feed back of the result and state of communication activities.</p>
