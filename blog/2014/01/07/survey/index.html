<div class="entry-content"><h3>Teenage Walkers Project Survey</h3>

<p>After one year half international exchange we asked all participating schools in Mie and North Carolina 16 queries to evaluate the activities in the Teenage Walkers Project.</p>

<p>The results are below for your reference.</p>

<h4>Q.1: Did you feel your partners existence across the national border?</h4>

<p>The sum of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the answers of Toshi Middle School was 26, &ldquo;A little&rdquo; was 4 and no one chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This query was set up to survey achievement of Self-Introduction Program in the first basic programs. Through this program we aimed that participating students could feel existence of their partners oversea. From the number of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;A little&rdquo; we estimate that almost all the students in Toshi Middle School had recognized their partners. The result of Guilford County Schools was that almost all the students had perceived existence of their partners as same as Toshi Middle School. None of them selected &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p>

<p>An interesting point is that the ratio of &ldquo;A little&rdquo; was a few more than the one in next question. Question No. 2 asked the students whether they could make a friendship with oversea or not in real life. But Question No. 1 inquired human relationship on the Internet. Though we can not say much about it because of a little difference, the students might feel familiar with each other in real life more than on the Internet. This questionnaire was done after one year half international exchange. We can not judge how much they would recognize their partners if we carry out this query in the middle of activities. At least the result of this question indicated a possibility that they could perceive their partners well on the Internet.</p>

<p>Obvious difference appeared in the result of other participating schools as compared with the one of Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools. A large fall of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, the ratio of &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; increased. We estimate that how long international exchange continued and how much activities was done might affect the background of this difference. And only Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools could implement homestays twice in a year and half. We guess that it was difficult for other schools&#8217; students to make a friend personally even they might have an interest in international exchange itself.</p>

<h4>Q.2: Did you make a friend of the person whose name and face you came to know through the international communication exchange?</h4>

<p>This question asked to determine achievement of the most important aim of Teenage Walkers Project. 28 students in Toshi Middle School said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and 2 of them &ldquo;Probably&rdquo;. All of 17 students in Guilford County Schools answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. No students in both countries chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This result revealed that all of the participating students realized the aim to make a friend oversea. We estimated that around 10 to 20 percentage of the students would be able to achieve the aim before stating the project. It was an outstanding consequence to evaluate the Teenage Walkers Project.</p>

<p>Within a year and half exchange period seven times live video conferences and twice home stay programs carried out affected this result. We think that real-time live video conference of good repute enabled the students exchange their voices and movies directly and living together in almost two weeks in the home stay programs produced face to face level communication which the Internet could never compensate for took a role to build the intimate friendship.</p>

<p>As compared with the result of Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools, other participating schools made a contrary result. Almost all students answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this question. Few of them chose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Probably&rdquo;. Though Question No. 1 asked the relationship on the Internet, this question inquired the personal friendship. Other participating schools were at a disadvantage to answer to this question because none of them held a home stay program. But a couple of students still said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;probably&rdquo; was unexpected considering no experience of direct communication. We guess that they found a friend through exchange activity on Bulletin Board in which they could write down their personal messages freely. This unforeseen result indicates a possibility that participants can make a friend oversea in cyberspace. But as a result of Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools it is obvious that face to face communication worked well to make a friendship with each other.</p>

<h4>Q.3: Did you enjoy the international activities as experienced through the Internet?</h4>

<p>This question inquired &ldquo;Did you enjoy the international activities as experienced through the Internet?&rdquo; to determine directly the result of international activities with the technology called Computer Meditated Communications Technology like the Internet. In Toshi Middle School 24 students, 80 percent of them answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 5 of them &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and 1 of them &ldquo;No&rdquo;. In Guilford County Schools 14 students said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 3 of them &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and None of them &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Though one student in Toshi Middle School chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;, almost all students in both countries seemed satisfied with the international activities on the Internet. Communication exchange program on Bulletin Board between them had been used actively after especially twice home stay programs. We can say that usage of Computer Meditated Communications Technology as a substitute for direct communication exchange was effective.</p>

<p>As to the result of other participating schools, in the Japanese schools the ratio of the students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; was not much, &ldquo;A little&rdquo; increased and &ldquo;No&rdquo; was a few. In the American schools, almost all the students chose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;A little&rdquo; was few and non of them &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We think the reason why the ratio of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; answered by the American students and &ldquo;No&rdquo; never chose is that many of them generally had no problem to use computer according to the result of Question No. 4 which asked computer usage and recent advanced computer education in America. For the present, we guess both of countries schools seemed satisfied the international activities on the Internet.</p>

<p>According to the answers to Question No. 14 asked most favorite activity in the Teenage Walkers Project, many students selected a live video conference program as their most favorite activity. We think that the program influenced the result of this question.</p>

<h4>Q.4: Were you able to make good use of the computer for international activities?</h4>

<p>Free description<br/>
1. It is difficult to think about the contents for home pages and scan a picture for them.<br/>
2. Translation into English was a hard job.<br/>
3. I had never used computer before so that even a single sentence I struggled to write.<br/>
4. I could learn how to use computer soon, but not teach other students.<br/>
5. Color combination for a home page was difficult.</p>

<p>Before starting the project almost all students in Toshi Middle School had had no experience to use latest model computers so that they needed to learn how to use them in advance. As a result of the practice 8 students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 19 ones &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and 3 of them &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Within about a half year applied on the practice they mastered word processing software for making a home page and technique of scanning a picture as a minimum requirement for the international activities on the Internet. It should be great advancement considering their initial condition.</p>

<p>As compared with the ration of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in Guilford County Schools there is still a gap of computer skill between both counties students. Considering advantage of computer education and the long experience which the American schools possessed the gap is not so much a problem. North Carolina is one the most well known states which has been putting great emphasis on computer and Internet education and Guilford County Schools is leading the top of them. From start there was an undeniable gap behind. But advancement to use computer is depended on how much each student have an interest in it. We can not easily determine the result from the difference of educational condition.</p>

<p>The result in other participating schools was similar to the one between Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools. Many American students chose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, a small number of them &ldquo;A little&rdquo;. None of them answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; as same as Guilford County Schools. We can understand the result considering all of the schools belong to North Carolina. According to the period of international activities the ration of &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the Japanese students varied. We think that the Japanese students got used to computer naturally through communication activities on the Internet.</p>

<h4>Q.5: Did you obtain the latest news about foreign culture directly from your partners?</h4>

<p>This question is related to Current Trend Introduction Program in the basic four introductory programs. This program was set for exchanging current trend information of countries and areas in which participating students live. The result of this question indicated how much information exchanged among them. The number of the students in Toshi Middle Schools who answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; was 9, &ldquo;A little&rdquo; was 11, and &ldquo;No&rdquo; was 10. On the other hand 6 students in Guilford County Schools answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and 6 did &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and 5 did &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As compared with the result of previous questions, the ratio of answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; increased in both countries schools. We think the reason why language problem was there between them. After the Current Trend Introduction Program held in the early stage of communication activities they had chances to exchange latest information through Bulletin Board or live video conferences. But all of the activities needed enough English ability to accomplish them. We guess that some of the students in Toshi Middle School felt difficulty to use English at all times. And the Bulletin Board was opened freely for the students. We observed one tendency that some students used it quite often and some others not so much. We guess the tendency caused one reason that the result varied widely.</p>

<p>Similar tendency were observed in other participating schools. The ratio of answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; increased. The reasons might be the language problem and frequent usage of Bulletin Board the same as between Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools.</p>

<p>Generally the ratio of &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the American schools was not much because of the advantage of English for the international activities.</p>

<h4>Q.6: Did you take an interest in your partner&rsquo;s culture?</h4>

<p>This question tried to survey how much interest in and understanding partner&rsquo;s culture the students of both countries had. This question is a little ambiguous as compared with Question No. 7 and 8. 20 students in Toshi Middle School answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 9 ones &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and 1 of them &ldquo;No&rdquo;. All of the students in Guilford County Schools answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Though it was sorry that one Japanese student chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;, this result indicated that many students of both countries had an interest in partner&rsquo;s culture.</p>

<p>In the background of all American students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, they took a Japanese class is a primary factor which effected the result. We easily guess that all of them had already had an interest in Japanese culture more or less before taking the class. And they had actually studied Japanese and the culture for a couple of years. Even considering these factors, this result should be a large step to lead understanding other cultures.</p>

<p>In other participating schools&#8217; result more than a few Japanese students said &ldquo;No&rdquo; particularly. We think that the reason is related to the result of Question No. 1 and 2. And owing to few chance for them to make a personal friend, it was difficult for them to have an interest in partner&rsquo;s culture. To the contrary few American students chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We estimate that the American students had more interest in Japanese culture than Japanese students who spend everyday life flooded with American culture.</p>

<p>The truth that there were students who answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; is an important issue. And it suggests that the international exchange programs in the Teenage Walkers Project should be necessarily improved.</p>

<h4>Q.7: Were there any interesting differences which your partner&rsquo;s culture had as compared with your own culture?</h4>

1. Foods and school life<br/>
2. I felt difference that people talked each other even between boys and girls or high school students and middle students in America.<br/>
3. They had a different idea about driver license and a mobile telephone<br/>
4. Customs about taking a bath and the procedure<br/>
5. Generous hospitality and kindness<br/>
6. I had an interest that many our out fashion music were in fashion in Japan.</p>

<p>This question was set to determine how much interest in partner&rsquo;s culture participating students had and whether they could take a good start for communication with the result through the basic four exchange programs.</p>

<p>It is difficult for international exchange to overcome the truth that culturally common and different parts exist when you compare your own culture with partner&rsquo;s one. When you try to communicate with persons who belong to other culture, if there is totally no common things between you, it is hard for you to have good contact with them. To the contrary if no difference exists, the necessity of communication decrease like hart to hart understanding without a word. It means cultural difference to a certain extent is essential for the start of communication. Because the difference will produce a topic to begin communication exchange.</p>

<p>The answer to this question in Toshi Middle School is that 14 students chose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 8 ones &ldquo;A little&rdquo;, 8 others &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The ratio of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is more than others but the answers were separated widely. Some students did not feel difference from American culture. On the other hand as compared with the result of Toshi Middle School, in Guilford County Schools 15 American students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 2 ones &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and no one &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This result indicates that they grasped differences from Japanese culture and were intrigued with them. We estimate that the way of accepting partner&rsquo;s culture would be definitely varied between the Japanese students living together with flooded American culture and the American students with not much Japanese culture.</p>

<p>This question set up space in which the students could write what kind of things actually they had an interest in. And some examples are above for your reference.</p>

<p>In other participating schools a similar result appeared. The answers of the Japanese students to the question separated widely and a large number of &ldquo;No&rdquo;. On the other hand almost all American students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and few &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p>

1. McDonalds and Nike bland shoes<br/>
2. Japanese students were taking foods almost as same as ours.<br/>
3. When I asked about a party, it was interesting to know what they were doing was almost as same as ours unexpectedly.<br/>
4. Famous Japanese TV programs was on air in America with different titles. And popular American artists.<br/>
5. Favorite movies like Titanic, music and recreations</p>

<p>This question is opposite from previous Question No. 7. As we explained the relationship between cultural difference and communication in Question No. 7, cultural difference create interest in partner&rsquo;s culture and a start of communication and cultural commonality produce affinity for sharing coincident matters. The affinity will be media to shorten psychological distance between students and lead to deepen communication among them. Like a chicken or egg question, we can not give a right answer to whether cultural difference or commonality should be first necessary for communication among different cultures. Both of them should be indispensable for the early stage of international communication exchange.</p>

<p>In the answers to the question of Toshi Middle School a half of the students said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We guess that they did not feel much difference in American culture which prevailed in Japanese society. Many American students in Guilford County Schools chose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and a few of them did &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This result indicated that the American students felt more interest in cultural matters than the Japanese students.</p>

<p>This question also set up space in which the students could write what kind of things actually they had an interest in. We introduced some examples which both countries students wrote above for your reference.</p>

<p>In other participating schools there was a gap between the American and Japanese result. Many &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the Japanese schools on the other hand a lot of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the American schools.</p>

1. music, movies, hair style, TV programs, sports, life style, school and so on<br/>
2. speaking a regional dialect<br/>
3. about our island and regional events<br/>
4. foods, life style and traditional arts<br/>
5. what we are living in everyday life</p>

<p>This question determined how much participating students could introduce their own culture to their partners contrary to Question No. 5, 6, 7?and 8 which asked how much they had an interest in partner&rsquo;s culture.</p>

<p>The basic programs like Current Trend Introduction or Area Introduction held in the early stage of international activities contained aim to set up a chance for participating students not only to understand partner&rsquo;s culture but also to review own culture through international exchange. Even common things in everyday life likely reflect differently on a person who belongs to another culture. In the early exchange programs we expected that the students could reevaluate their own culture which their partners looked at in a new light. Understanding international exchange by taking a broad view of things on the premise of international society is important. On the other hand it also needs for communication exchange among different cultures to understand own culture and introduce it to partners. Though this question set up with the aim, we doubt how much the students could understand the aim considering their age. We think that they simply answered the question by how much they could introduce their culture quantitatively.</p>

<p>As the result of the question 16 students in Toshi Middle School answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 11 ones &ldquo;A little&rdquo;. Generally they could introduce their own culture. In Guilford County Schools the number of each answer was almost same. A specific feature between both countries&#8217; result is that the ratio of &ldquo;No&rdquo; in Guilford County Schools was more than in Toshi Middle School. We think that the Japanese students made School and Area Introduction home pages by themselves on the other hand teachers of the American students did the jobs instead of them caused influence on the specific feature. The entity of international activities in Guilford County Schools was divided by plural high schools so that they could not contact with each other smoothly to progress the group activities.</p>

<p>The result of other participating schools was that the ratio of &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; increased in number more than &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on the Japanese side and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in number was more than other answers on the American side. The tendency of this result was different from the one between Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools. We guess the reason is that the American students made the home pages by themselves and introduced their own culture through live video conference programs too.</p>

<p>The samples of what kind of culture the students of both countries introduced are there above for your reference.</p>

<p>Many students in Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Almost all students had an experience to visit partner&rsquo;s country and spent a nice time with together. It is natural to think that they wanted to visit again. On the other hand we do not exactly why some students chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. But considering the result of next Question No. 12 which asked the students if they want to accept partners in their home again was that no one of both countries answered &ldquo;No&rdquo;, the students answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; in this question had no discontent with their partners. We guess that they could not get used to travel abroad or wanted to visit other countries without America or Japan.</p>

<p>Almost all American students in other participating schools wanted to visit Japan and only one chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. As same as the result of Question No. 6 they seemed to have an interest in Japanese culture and an strong desire to go to Japan. In the result of other Japanese participating schools it is interesting that many students in Maryknoll Girls&#8217; School said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. We think the reason why some of them had already experienced to visit abroad before.</p>

<p>As compared with the previous Question No. 10 asked whether students wanted to visit partner&rsquo;s country or not, it seems almost same but this question asked what kind of impression on home stays the students have.</p>

<p>23 students in Toshi Middle School answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and 5 &ldquo;A little&rdquo; followed. 80 percent of the students from the ratio of answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; seemed satisfied the home stay program held in America August 1998. Unfortunately some students said &ldquo;No&rdquo; as same as Question No. 10. Not only staying abroad is enjoyable but also it requests certain burdens to overcome communication problem and different life style. They seemed not to have a good memory of the homestay.</p>

<p>On the other hand almost all students in Guilford County Schools including the result of 14 &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and 3 &ldquo;A little&rdquo; enjoyed themselves in the home stay held in Japan January 1999. No one answered &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In other participating schools a large gap was appeared between Japanese schools and American schools. Though the result was separated widely, some students on the Japanese side chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. On the other hand the ratio of answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on the American side was high and a few &ldquo;A little&rdquo;. Other participating schools did not open home stay programs like between Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools. Without some students in Maryknoll Girls&#8217; School many of the students had never experienced to visit another county. We expected to realize home stay programs by other participating schools too. But it was difficult for them to do it financially or due to different school system.</p>

<p>We hope that the students of other schools can implement home stay programs individually in the future. But in reality it still seems hard for them to go abroad for homestays as they wish though the price of airplane ticket decreased.</p>

<p>This question asked whether the students want homestays or not regardless of actual implementation. But some students who answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; might think that they can not do it by themselves.</p>

<p>This question determined if participating students could accept their partners in their home in contrast to Question No. 11 which asked if they wanted to visit their partner&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p>Many students in Toshi Middle School answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and a few &ldquo;A little&rdquo;. There was no student chose &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The result is obviously different from the one of Question No. 10 and 11 which included some students said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We guess that the students said &ldquo;No&rdquo; wanted to accept their partners instead of going abroad. As long as they stay in Japan, they can communicate with their partners in comfortable environment which they know well and are not required an environmental adoption. In Guilford County Schools a lot of students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and none of them &ldquo;No&rdquo; as followed with Question No. 11.</p>

<p>There was not answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; means that every students&#8217; families can accept partners again. We expect that they will extend more individual communication exchange from now on. And it also means that the twice home stay programs worked well.</p>

<p>In other participating schools, the result was different from the one of Question No. 11. The ratio of answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the Japanese schools decreased. As same as Toshi Middle School we think if a communication exchange condition is comfortable for them, the Japanese students want to meet their partners directly. We can understand well their feeling to request safe environment to communicate with their partner though it seems passive commitment to international exchange. We think through direct communication exchange if they can deepen their friendship they will start to visit their countries or homes each other sooner or later.</p>

<p>Free description
1. I would like to continue communication exchange through the Internet and especially homestays.<br/>
2. From now on I will communicate with more people directly for building human relationship.<br/>
3. I want to discuss with a variety of people through Bulletin Board.<br/>
4. Not through live video conference system I would like to meet and talk with my partners directly.<br/>
5. I want to extend friendship with more people.</p>

<p>This question asked what kind of impression on Teenage Walkers Project participating students had. The actual impressions on the project was gathered in the result of later question. We collected quantitatively the sum of their impressions with answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Probably&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this question.</p>

<p>Answers &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; selected by 25 students in Toshi Middle School got a majority. &ldquo;A little &rdquo; chosen by 2 ones. &ldquo;No&rdquo; picked by 3 of them. The result of this question suggested that 80 percent of the students seemed satisfied the activities in the Teenage Walkers Project. As an experimental project for international activities with the Internet we can say this project was well done.</p>

<p>On the other hand all students selected &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in Guilford County Schools. This result means Teenage Walkers Project was evaluated well too on the American side.</p>

<p>In other participating schools the results between American and Japanese schools was varied each other. There were many students chose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, a few &ldquo;A little&rdquo; and none of them &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the American side. On the other hand the ratio of &ldquo;Probably&rdquo; increased and some of them said &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the Japanese side. As compared with the international activities between Toshi Middle School and Guilford County Schools, the communication exchange period was shorter and there was no home stay program in other participating schools. Considering these conditions some of the Japanese students was not satisfied well international activities only on the Internet.</p>

<p>We feel regret that the evaluation of Teenage Walkers Project by the Japanese students was a little lower. On the other hand the American students thought highly of the project and wished to continue it. We do not know exactly why the gap happened because we did not examine it thoroughly. As far as we can estimate each participating school had own arrangement and support system for the international activities that caused the gap.</p>

<h4>Q.14: What was your most favorite activity in the Teenage Walkers Project?</h4>

<p>Students who participated in Teenage Walkers Project could write their most favorite activities freely. Some sample answers which the students actually wrote down was below for your reference.</p>

<p>Generally a live video conference program was most popular in every participating schools. From the first the program was well received so that we can easily predict the result. A shocking scene of real-time live movies and sounds of partners crossing over the border is similar to a future TV telephone. Opening a communication activity with this live video conference system produced precious opportunities for every students in both countries to know each other.</p>

<p>Just one month before conducting this questionnaire a home stay program was held between Guilford County Schools and Toshi Middle School so that many American students chose the visit in Japan as their most enjoyable activity. It is interesting to see that some students wrote their experience in Japan like eating Japanese food, wearing Kimono or spending a nice time with their host family.</p>
