<div class="entry-content"><h3>Details of Activity Program</h3>

<p>[Activities at First and Second Stages]<br/>
(Self-Introduction Program)<br/>
This program offers opportunities for the participating students to get to know each other through the preparation of self-introductory homepages and also provides an initial opportunity for communication and presentation activities.</p>

<p>Sample Case</p>

<p>(Current Trend Introduction Program)<br/>
Participating students will organize the results of surveys on interesting things and new trends, summarize them by item, and exhibit them on their homepage. Through this exhibition, they will understand some of the survey items that are common to different areas. These common items should provide ideas for communication. They will also understand that different cultures still exist and introduce these features. This will encourage the students to show an interest in cultural exchange.</p>

<p>(School Introduction Program)<br/>

<p>(Area Introduction Program)<br/>
Participating students will exhibit their local area reports on the Internet after selecting themes in their residential area and interviewing local residents. They will become aware of the current situation of their local culture and encourage a re-assessment of that culture by exhibiting it internationally.</p>

<p>[Activities at Third and Fourth Stages]<br/>
(Exchange Exhibition Program by Group)<br/>
Both schools will conduct study and presentation activities in their group, which comprises 5 or 6 members. Each group should decide the theme, conduct study and presentation activities, and exhibit the results of the study and presentation activities. Members will gain experience of cooperation with people in a different culture. They may be able to publicize their activities globally,
if the exhibition achieves successful results. The tools for this program will be a home page or bulletin board.</p>

<p>(Exchange Exhibition Program by Individuals)<br/>
The next stage of the group exchange offers an opportunity for a member to select a partner for joint study and presentation activities in another school based on their own particular interests. The results of this joint activity could also be exhibited. Through this program, members should find a friend for long-term international exchange and benefit from the strength of the international community.  They may be able to publicize their activities globally, if the exhibition achieves successful results. The tools for this program will be a home page or bulletin board.</p>

<p><A href="bulletin.htm">Sample Activity</A></p>

<p>[Activities at Fifth Stage]<br/>
(Exchange Exhibition Program by School)<br/>
By Event<br/>
Each School organizes events to provide an opportunity for exchange and exhibitions.  All of the members of the class decide on the event program. An event may be in the style of an &lsquo;exposition&rsquo;, where groups exhibit the results jointly. The tools for this program will be a home page or live video conference system.</p>

<p>By Forum<br/>
A forum will be organized to provide exchange and study activities by school. The forum program should be decided by all of the school.  Results of the individual study theme can possibly become the school theme. The tools for this program will be a live video conference system.</p>

<p><A href="lvc.htm">Sample Activity</A></p>

<p>[Activities at Sixth Stage]<br/>
(Direct Exchange Program)<br/>
Both partners can meet and conduct direct exchange like homestay after getting to know each other through the network. This will promote a deeper understanding of different cultures and encourage long-term exchange.</p>

<p>[Activities at Seventh Stage]<br/>
(Area Exchange Support Program)<br/>
As a result of the previous stages, participating students can conduct PR supporting activities for international exchanges. Participants in areas where exchange activities are well developed should support exchange programs in other areas where internationalization and information technology are not so developed. Examples of these activities include charity appeals and donation activities and any other action program in which they can participate.  Hopefully, these activities may be upgraded to GII, where the citizens can participate directly. The ultimate objective of the Teenage Walkers Project, i.e., international exchange covering different areas of the world for the promotion of further cultural development among the international community, should be achieved by this program.</p>
